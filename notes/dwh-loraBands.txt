HeyMac's preliminary set of modes use the LoRa Chirp Spread Spectrum protocol
in the 70cm band with 250 KHz and 500 KHz bandwidths.

The 70cm amateur band occupies 420.000 - 450.000 MHz.
The best place in the ARRL band plan [ArrlBandPlan] for
a 70cm digital mode with bandwidth > 100 KHz seems to be:

    Freq range      Width   Use
    432.30-432.40   100 KHz Propagation beacons
    432.40-433.00   600 KHz Mixed-mode and weak-signal work

For BW = 500 KHz, one center frequency:           432.700
allows 50 KHz guard bands on both sides.

For BW = 250 KHz, two center frequencies:   432.550     432.850
allows 25 KHz guard bands on four sides.
