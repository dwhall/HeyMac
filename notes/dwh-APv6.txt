APv6 Networks
=============

APv6 takes the HeyMac NetId and gives further meaning to each field.

NetId := AVIS (6,2,5,3 bits)
    App         the purpose of hosting the net
    Version     the appâ€™s protocol compatibility value (must change version when protocol is incompatible)
    Instance    a value to distinguish one App+Version from another (random at init) (equiv of DODAG Version)
    Sequence    a value to distinguish one shape of this net from another (increment w/rollover when branches change)

Tree Collision:
A node detects two NetIds w/same [AVI]S, but different LongAddr/PubKey
This requires beacons to contain: {NetId, MySaddr, RootsLongAddr}
Node sends NetMgmt,DupNetApps to ONE of the roots (which one?)
Root should incr AVIS Instance field and push new NetId to its tree
