# To install a module of a specific version:
#   prototype: pip install --user <modulename>==<version>
#   example:   pip install --user asn1=2.2.0

# asciimatics is only required for the example program with the text UI.
# asciimatics is NOT required by the HeyMac communication stack itself.
# HeyMac UI's use of asciimatics requires source changes more recent than any release.
